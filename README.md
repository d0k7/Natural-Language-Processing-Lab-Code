# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Lab Code

## Overview
This repository contains code examples and implementations for various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks commonly encountered in research and development. The code is organized based on specific questions and tasks to provide a structured and comprehensive resource for NLP enthusiasts and practitioners.

## Table of Contents

1. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Code for cleaning and preprocessing text data, including tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and stop-word removal.

2. **Text Classification**
   - Implementations of various text classification algorithms using machine learning and deep learning approaches.

3. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
   - Code for identifying and classifying entities (e.g., names, locations, organizations) within text documents.

4. **Word Embeddings**
   - Examples of generating and utilizing word embeddings using techniques like Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText.

5. **Sequence Labeling**
   - Implementations of models for sequence labeling tasks such as Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging.

6. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**
   - Code snippets for implementing RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs for sequence-based tasks in NLP.

7. **Sentiment Analysis**
   - Examples of sentiment analysis models for determining the sentiment polarity of text.

8. **Chatbot Development**
   - Code for creating a basic chatbot using the ChatterBot library, with training on a conversation corpus.
